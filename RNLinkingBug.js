This error occurs when using a library that depends on native modules and those native modules aren't properly linked or configured for your specific platform (Android or iOS).  The symptoms usually involve seemingly random crashes or runtime errors, especially when interacting with platform-specific functionalities.  The error might not be immediately apparent in the JavaScript code but rather in the native layer.
