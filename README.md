# React Native Native Module Linking Errors

This repository demonstrates a common yet often elusive bug in React Native related to native module linking.  This kind of error manifests as unexpected crashes or runtime errors without clear error messages in the JavaScript code itself. The root cause lies in the communication bridge between JavaScript and the native (Objective-C/Java) modules.

## Problem
When integrating native modules into your React Native application, errors can arise from incorrect linking, missing dependencies, or incompatibilities between different library versions. These errors often lack detailed stack traces, making debugging very challenging.

## Solution
The proposed solution involves carefully checking the steps of native module linking for both Android and iOS platforms, ensuring that all dependencies are met and configurations are correct. This includes checking your `build.gradle` (Android) and `Podfile` (iOS) configurations, and ensuring that the native modules are correctly compiled and linked with the React Native environment.

## Reproducing the Bug
The `RNLinkingBug.js` file contains example code that attempts to use a native module that is not correctly linked (either intentionally or due to a configuration oversight). Run the application and attempt to trigger the functionality utilizing the native module to observe the crash or unexpected behavior.

## Fixing the Bug
The solution in `RNLinkingBugSolution.js` addresses the issue by providing the necessary steps to correctly link and configure the native module within the React Native project for both Android and iOS platforms. Refer to the commented code and accompanying instructions for detailed steps.
