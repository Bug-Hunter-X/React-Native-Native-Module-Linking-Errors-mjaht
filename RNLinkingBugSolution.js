// ... (React Native code)

// Solution: Check the linking of the native module
//  1. Verify Android linking: Check your `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure the native module is properly included as a dependency.
//  2. Verify iOS linking: Check your `ios/Podfile` and ensure the pod for the native module is listed and installed.  Run `pod install` in the `ios` directory.
//  3. Check for missing native dependencies:  Native modules may require other native libraries. Check their documentation for additional dependencies.
//  4. Clean and rebuild: After any configuration changes, clean and rebuild the project (both Android and iOS) to ensure that changes are reflected properly.
//  5. Check for conflicting library versions:  Conflicts between library versions can lead to such issues. Ensure all your dependencies are compatible.
